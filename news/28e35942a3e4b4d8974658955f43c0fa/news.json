Yesterday Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed that the party remains committed to eventually investing \u00a328billion a year to help the environment if it wins power. She claimed the huge sum for jobs and technology would be paid for responsibly, having already pushed back its planned introduction in a U-turn last month. Ms Reeves told the BBC: 'I've always been clear that all our policies, including investing in the industries in the future and boosting our energy security, are subject to our fiscal rules.' She said this 'means paying for day-to-day spending through tax receipts and getting debt down'.\n...read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n shares\n    \n\n\nHow Labour's green energy splurge could cost an extra \u00a310 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Labour's green energy splurge could cost an extra \u00a310 billion\nDAN HODGES: The closer Starmer gets to No 10, the more desperate he is to conceal what he'll do if elected\n02/07/23 01:08\nDAN HODGES: Starmer has decided his route to securing power lies in pulling the wool over the eyes of the electorate.
