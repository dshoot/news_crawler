Despite ministers' calls for the NHS to cut back on 'waste and wokery', some groups use taxpayers' money to put on events around \ntransgender\n issues, sexuality and racism, often held during the working day.\nThese have included 'tea and rainbow cake' picnics, a special session about pronouns and\u00a0a Filipino martial arts performance. Amid fears of an impending winter NHS crisis, the audit by the TaxPayers' Alliance found there are now at least 493 networks across the UK health service.\nThese took up at least 108,807 hours of dedicated staff time over the last three years and cost the taxpayer \u00a31,081,878 in this period.\nThe true figures are likely to be higher as only 111 out of more than 230 trusts responded to Freedom of Information requests. They only cover time spent running the groups, not attending them.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite ministers' calls for the NHS to cut back on 'waste and wokery', some groups use taxpayers' money to put on events around transgender issues, sexuality and racism, often held during the working day. Pictured: NHS staff at London Pride in 2019\nIt is feared the NHS is heading for another crisis this winter as it faces seasonal pressures and a post-Covid backlog in treatment.\nDespite the National Insurance hike to raise funds and help clear the backlog, waiting lists have hit record highs. This week, the precarious state of emergency care was laid bare when one woman was forced to wait 40 hours for an ambulance. Last night, critics suggested taxpayers would be angered by the scale of NHS spending on 'right-on' causes.\u00a0\nElliot Keck, investigations campaign manager at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Many of the networks are a questionable use of NHS time and taxpayers' money. While Brits wait patiently for their appointments and operations, NHS middle managers are busy organising right-on lectures and social events. Health chiefs need to scale back some of these unnecessary 'woke' networks.'\n \n \n \nRELATED ARTICLES\n \n \nPrevious\n \n1\n \nNext\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n'We must ensure no other family ever goes through this...\n \n \n \n \nUK's longest surviving heart transplant patient dies aged 80...\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n \nThe \u00a31million cost of the groups may appear nominal relative to the annual NHS budget for England of \u00a3152billion but MPs say the money could be better used elsewhere.\nMultiple trusts admitted they plan to increase the number of networks they support, the funding they receive and the amount of time staff can dedicate to them.\nConservative MP David Jones said: 'When patients are being denied operations and waiting too long for care, expending taxpayers' money on networks like this seems wasteful at best and sinful at worst.'\n\u00a0Fellow Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope said: 'The funding and staff time going into these groups is symptomatic of the waste within the NHS. The Health Secretary should use it as an example of how existing funds could be spent more efficiently next time bosses ask for more.'\nStaff networks are most likely to focus on LGBT issues, with 101 of the NHS groups related to this cause nationwide. This is followed by race, with 99 networks.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConservative MP David Jones, pictured, said that spending money on networks such as these when patients are being denied operations and waiting too long for care seems 'wasteful' at best and 'sinful' at worst\n \nThe LGBTea party and other woke events\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \nAt an Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust LGBT network event in April a guest speaker shared their 'lived experience of using our services as a transgender person'.\nUniversity Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust BAME Network held an event with Larissa Kennedy, of Woman Deliver, who has previously described the Government as 'classist, racist, ableist'\nThe Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board held a 'LGBTea: picnic with tea and rainbow cake' in June.\nBarnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust are planning a 'Pronouns Day' for December.\nEast and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust celebrated Philippines Independence Day in June, with 'food for up to 200 staff, martial arts and music'.\n\u00a0\n \nAdvertisement\n\n\n \nNotably, not all trusts provide their networks with funding, which raises questions about why others feel it is necessary to do so.\nHywel Dda University Health Board, which gave its LGBTQ+ network \u00a31,000 last year, said: 'There is an expectation that line managers will allow staff time to attend meetings and events associated with their network. This would normally equate to approximately one hour a month for network members.'\nChelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it is discussing a protected time agreement so staff networks can 'flourish'.\n\u00a0And according to North Middlesex University Hospital Trust's equality, diversity and inclusion strategy, 'the principal purpose of such staff networks is to inform and support the trust's aims, values and objectives especially in the promotion of equality, diversity and inclusion in the management of staff and delivery of services'. Specific aims include 'organising celebration and awareness-raising days and events'.\nThe revelations came as the President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine warned of a 'major crisis' in the ambulance service.\nAnd Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, warned the NHS is likely to experience the 'most difficult winter on record'.\n\u00a0In June, then health secretary Sajid Javid ordered the NHS to cut 'diversity and inclusion' managers as part of a crackdown on 'waste and wokery', saying their salaries of up to \u00a3115,000 could be better spent on the front line.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to North Middlesex University Hospital Trust's equality, diversity and inclusion strategy, the purpose of these staff networks is to inform and support the trust's aims, values and objectives in promoting diversity, equality and inclusion . Pictured: North Middlesex Hospital (stock image)\nSaffron Cordery, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: 'At a time when the NHS is under such sustained pressure and trusts are facing 100,000 vacancies, it is paramount that they invest in the wellbeing of their staff. The time and money put in these networks are a proportionate investment in an NHS workforce of 1.2million staff in England.\n'All the evidence points to an engaged and inclusive workforce delivering better patient care.'\nAn NHS spokesman said: 'While it is down to individual trusts to decide how they best support their own staff, these voluntary networks provide a channel to address concerns from a wide range of staff, which helps improve services for patients.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n                        \n\n\nNHS blows \u00a31million on 'woke groups' for staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne-mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n856\n\n\nshares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments \n1414\n\n\n\n\t    Share what you think\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest rated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst rated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nView all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter search term:\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDON'T MISS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          BBC bosses will meet with Scotland Yard TODAY over sex pics scandal after under-fire corporation suspends top presenter\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Cara Delevingne responds to suggestions she shut down grid chat with Sky Sports' Martin Brundle, leaving F1 legend furious at Grand Prix\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Barbie's big moment in black!
