On the same day, 170 miles away in the Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, former air stewardess \nCarole Middleton\n delivered her own first child, Catherine.\nIt wasn't until 2007, when photos of \nPrince William\n's girlfriend on her 25th birthday appeared in the newspapers that Gemma and Claire clocked the connection.\n'That day had always been crazy,' laughed Gemma. 'It's Mum's birthday as well as our own. It was Mum who spotted the link with \nKate Middleton\n first \u2013 saying to us, \"You could have been Prince William's girlfriend!\" It became a running joke.'\nSuperficially, Gemma, a product designer, and Claire, who does voluntary work, have little in common with the future Queen. However, Gemma's career trajectory has been similar to Kate's: both were educated at private schools and both followed their parents into the family business.\nAfter leaving the independent Stonefield House School (now York Minster School), Gemma got a degree at Bradford University before training as a paramedic and working for the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClaudia Joseph spoke to four women who were born on January, 9, 1982, the same day as the Princess of Wales (pictured), to see how their lives compare\nLike the Middleton children, who helped at their parents' party- planning firm, Gemma joined her parents Jeremy and Sally at their company Medicircle, which organises commercial first-aid boxes. She then set up Firstaid4Sport, an affiliated company, which she sold 18 months ago.\nShe and her husband Michael now work as consultants and run two companies, Hobbledehoo, manufacturing children's safety harnesses, and The Spanish Boot Company, selling leather riding boots. By coincidence, Kate owns a pair.\nGemma and Michael married at St Andrew's Church in Boothby Graffoe in 2009. They have two children: Megan, 11, and Maxwell, ten. Gemma vividly remembers the Royal Wedding because she was in hospital with her daughter, who had an infection.\nSo, does Gemma share any characteristics with her fellow Capricorn? 'I'm very sporty,' she admits. 'I played hockey too, and I ski. We're very rural and we live in the countryside with our three dogs.\n'I've never really looked into astrology enough to warrant a belief in it \u2013 but I do feel that certain people have similar traits.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFamily affair:\u00a0Gemma and Claire share their birthday with their mum\nLike the Middleton children, who helped at their parents' party- planning firm, Gemma joined her parents Jeremy and Sally at their company Medicircle, which organises commercial first-aid boxes.

We're very rural and we live in the countryside with our three dogs.\n'I've never really looked into astrology enough to warrant a belief in it \u2013 but I do feel that certain people have similar traits.'\n\u00a0\n \nThe solicitor with the same name, too\nKate Haigh,\u00a0\n41, not only shares the Princess of Wales's birthday but also her name.\nShe discovered the link when her grandmother spotted she was an astrotwin to Prince William's then girlfriend.\nBut even though Kate admires the Princess, she says she wishes she had been born the day before.\n'Both Elvis Presley and David Bowie were born on January 8,' she says. 'And I'm a massive Elvis fan.'\nA typical Capricorn, she shares the Princess of Wales's love of motherhood.\nShe and her construction manager husband Lee were married at St Augustine's Church near Beverley, East Yorkshire, in 2017 and have two daughters, Elizabeth, six, and Isabella, who was born last month.\n'The only similarities between me and the Princess are that we are happily married,' she tells me.\n'Though we both seem to enjoy charity work. Mine is not on her scale \u2013 but I've fundraised for many years for various charities.Unlike Kate, I went to a comprehensive school and have never been any good at hockey.'\nKate grew up with her parents, Bob and Caroline, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. She has a younger sister, 37-year-old Sally.\nAfter studying history at Hull University, Kate did a post-graduate diploma in legal practice before training for her 'dream job' as a solicitor.\nShe set up her own company, Stewart & Co Solicitors in 2010, and specialises in employment law and litigation.\nShe's also a governor at her local primary school.\n'I'm a mother, a wife, a business owner and a solicitor all in one,' she said. 'I loved Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Family.\n'I was fascinated to watch William and Kate's romance develop and see how they're growing old together.\n'I remember vividly their wedding as I took the day off to watch it on TV\u2026 and have some new garden furniture built \u2013 multi-tasking at its best!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKate Haigh (pictured), 41, not only shares the Princess of Wales's birthday but also her name\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nThe sporty surveyor with Kate's kindness\u00a0\nVictoria Groves did not realise that she shared a birthday with the Princess until they both turned 40 last year.\nShe said: 'I read some reference to Kate turning 40 and I thought it was amusing because we couldn't have led more different lives. We've got the same-coloured hair, but that's about it.'\nHowever, Victoria, who doesn't believe in astrology, does have some interests in common with Kate. 'I had tennis lessons growing up, played hockey at school and lacrosse at university,' she said. She also admits to having watched Kate and William's wedding. 'Though I'm not really a Royalist, I think the monarchy is part of our culture and history. Their wedding was a happy occasion,' she says.\nVictoria grew up with her parents, Stuart and Patricia, and her two siblings. She studied history at the University of East Anglia, got a postgraduate diploma in surveying and now works as a chartered surveyor, specialising in planning and development.\nUnmarried, she moved back to live with her mother after her father's death in 2018 and is currently house-hunting nearby.\nTalking of her astrotwin, Victoria said: 'Kate comes across as an empathetic person who takes an interest in people from all different backgrounds. I hope I'm like that.\n'But, to be brutally honest, I don't think I would like her job.\nSome people aspire to be princesses but I don't think I'd appreciate or be able to cope with the criticism.'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVictoria Groves (pictured) did not realise that she shared a birthday with the Princess until they both turned 40 last year\u00a0\n\u00a0\n \nThe mother who would have gone for Harry\u00a0\nAlex Bollard only recently learnt she shared a birthday with Kate when her mother Joy, now 80, visited her in New Zealand.\nShe emigrated five years ago with her husband, Simon, and their three daughters: Phoebe, 12, and twins Jessica and Grace, ten.\n'My mum is more of a Royalist than I am,' she laughs. 'But I'm very proud of the monarchy, too.'\nAlex said she recently joked with a friend about how she shares a birthday with the future Queen.\n'They told me that they could tell! I thought the comment was quite rude, because obviously I look nothing like her,' she said.\nBorn in Farnborough Maternity Hospital in Kent, Alex travelled the world with her father, a New Zealander and oil-rig engineer, and mother \u2013 living in Abu Dhabi, Norway and Cyprus. When she was five, her parents split up and her father moved back to New Zealand. He died in 2000.\nWhen Alex was 12, she and her mother settled in Blandford Forum in Dorset, where she went to school and then studied photography \u2013 an interest she shares with Kate \u2013 and did a course in childcare. This too is a subject, of course, which the Princess is passionate about.\nShe and her husband married in 2009 and Alex was given away by her uncle, a sound recordist for Sir David Attenborough.\nThe couple now live in Paraparaumu, on New Zealand's North Island, with their three children and cat.\nAsked if she might have liked to marry Prince William, she jokes: 'Harry was my favourite all along. Sorry William.'\nShe says William and Kate are her 'hope' that the monarchy will keep modernising, 'making it more relatable to all of us'.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlex Bollard (pictured) only recently learnt she shared a birthday with Kate when her mother Joy, now 80, visited her in New Zealand \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0...And the member of another famous family\nJulia Gray, the daughter of the former PM's father Stanley Johnson, was also born on the same day as the Princess of Wales \u2013 in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, where Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were all born.\nJulia is one of the 82-year-old former MEP's six children. There is also Boris, journalist Rachel, management guru Leo and politician Jo \u2013 from his marriage to Charlotte Wahl \u2013 and her younger brother, Max.
