The pair are pictured together in July 2021\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRoyal analysts claim Harry, 38, had a heartfelt talk with his father on Saturday, but has not addressed the ongoing dispute with William. It is also understood that there will be no time for the pair to meet during the trip. Pictured: Harry, Meghan, William, Kate and Charles in 2020\nThe royal analyst noted it would be 'nice' for Harry to 'stick around and be friendly'. However, it is understood that the Duke's solo trip across the pond will be short.\n'Out of politeness you'd think Harry would want to mingle with his family no matter how difficult that might be for him,' she said.\nMs Seward added that she is 'glad' Harry has spoken with Charles because it has 'eased the path to rapprochement'.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWilliam, 40, and Harry will see each other during the Coronation at Westminster Abbey on May 6. This is understood to be the first time the pair will face each other since Harry released his memoir, Spare, in January - which saw him brand his brother as his 'arch-nemesis'\nShe said: 'Charles will welcome his son. I think his relationship with William is for another time.'\u00a0\nWilliam, 40, and Harry will see each other during the Coronation at Westminster Abbey on May 6.\nThis is understood to be the first time the pair will face each other\u00a0since Harry released his memoir, Spare, in January - which saw him brand\u00a0his brother as his 'arch-nemesis'.\nHarry has also publicly called on his family to apologise to himself and Meghan for what they see as slights.\u00a0\nCharles is said to be very pleased his youngest son is coming and his mood is described as 'generally quite forgiving', however, the Prince of Wales is understood to \nstill feel betrayed and angry\n, particularly by the revelations in the memoirs.\u00a0\nSources have recently alleged t\nhe 'gulf' between the brothers, who were once as close as siblings could be, is now so large\u00a0\nthey cannot see how their relationship can ever be repaired.\u00a0\nIt is also reportedly unlikely that the pair will have a sit down - which insiders have previously claimed that Harry demanded.\nWilliam had no contact with his brother when he came over with Meghan and the children for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations last year.\nAnd the brothers barely spoke at her funeral later in the year, meeting briefly when William invited him and Meghan to join him and Kate to meet the public and view the flowers outside Windsor Castle.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRoyal Family members on the day of the Queen's funeral in London on September 19, 2022 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBut the King hopes his Coronation can heal some of those wounds. He will also use the historic event to bring his younger brother Prince Andrew in 'from the cold'.\nHis ex-wife Sarah, the Duchess of York, is not invited and will watch the Westminster Abbey ceremony at home where she plans to hang bunting and chomp on coronation chicken sandwiches like millions of others.\nOne friend told The Daily Telegraph earlier this week that 'there's a warmth around the place and a proper rallying around the King, who in turn is showing some serious EQ [emotional intelligence] by ensuring the family is given the opportunity to pull together.'\u00a0\nThe insider added: 'All four siblings spent most of the Easter weekend together with assorted children and plus ones - including the Duchess [of York].\n'I suspect some Palace staff and parts of the media are well behind the curve in their understanding of this private family unity. The Duke [of York] stands four square behind the King.'\nSussex supporters said Harry understood that the Coronation is the biggest day of his father's life and felt it was right to be present, despite his attacks on the family.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKing Charles III and the Queen Consort during a visit to Malton, North Yorkshire, on April 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle and then-Prince Charles at Westminster Abbey in March 2019\nHarry will attend his father's Coronation alone, with Meghan set to remain in California\u00a0with Prince Archie \u2013 who turns four that day \u2013 and Princess Lilibet, one.\nThe Duke is only planning on a flying visit, with sources close to the Sussexes indicating last week that he won't even return to Buckingham Palace to gather with the rest of the family or take part in any further events over the Coronation weekend.\u00a0\nMeghan's biographer Omid Scobie tweeted: 'Expect it to be a fairly quick trip to the UK for Prince Harry.'\u00a0\nHis decision to attend the Westminster Abbey Coronation service is viewed as a potential olive branch by royal insiders, following an earlier demand that his family should apologise to him and Meghan if they were to consider coming.\nBut he is not expected to take part in the procession after the service or join other members of the Royal Family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, or for other celebrations.\nSources told \nThe Daily Mail\n that the decision by Meghan to remain in the US with the couple's two young children had come as a relief in some circles, following fears her presence could have heightened family tensions.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe late Queen Elizabeth II, Charles, Camilla, William, Kate, Harry and Meghan attend the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March 9, 2020\u00a0\nIt is also understood there was real concern in the Sussex camp about the public reception the couple would have received if they attended the Coronation together.\nFriends, including Mr Scobie, suggested her decision was largely due to the Coronation falling on the same day \u2013 May 6 \u2013 as Archie's fourth birthday.\nThe couple had delayed answering their invitation for weeks, causing difficulties for organisers tasked with complex seating plans, transport and security for senior members of the Royal Family, world leaders and other dignitaries.\nSources described the negotiations as a game of 'transatlantic ping pong', and Harry was said to have wanted numerous assurances about arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n\n\nPrince Harry and William 'have no plans for a reunion during visits for King Charles'
