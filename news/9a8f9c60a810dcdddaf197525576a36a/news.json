Police chiefs argued that 'tougher sentences' - such as jail time - are the 'strongest deterrence' to disruptive behaviour, a source inside the meeting said. It was noted that after the two JSO protesters who scaled the bridge and brought gridlock to the Dartford Crossing were jailed for causing public nuisance, the organisation seemed to scale back its protests\u00a0on major roads. A government source suggested consulting the Sentencing Council about reviewing sentencing guidelines because 'they're not considering the wider impact of these protests'.\n...read\n comment\ns\n2\n video\ns\n share\ns\nAuthor Patricia Nicol reveals a selection of the best books on: Cricket\n09/07/23 07:24\nUK author Patricia Nicol recommends Netherland by Joseph O'Neill - set in Manhattan post-9/11 - and Aravind Adiga's Selection Day, which follows the ambition of a Mumbai chutney-seller.\n1\n comment\n1\n share\nCelebrities descend on British Grand Prix amid tight security over fears of Just Stop Oil protest: Stars flock to Silverstone with bosses on high alert for eco-mob disruption\n09/07/23 03:07\nSpice Girl Geri Horner cut a stylish figure in a white denim jumpsuit, while Brad Pitt arrived at the world-famous circuit dressed as fictional race car driver Sonny Hayes from his new movie Apex.\n265\n comment\ns\n17\n share\ns\nArriving in style!
