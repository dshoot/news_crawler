The Crown of Scotland, the impressive centrepiece of the collection, was placed on the coffin of the late Queen during a moving service at St Giles' Cathedral after her death last year.\nIt features a circlet made of Scottish gold with 22 gemstones, 20 precious stones including diamonds and amethysts and freshwater pearls from Scottish rivers. Four gold arches rise to an orb which is painted blue and decorated with stars and a gold cross sits on top, which is studded with a large amethyst and eight pearls.\nMade of solid silver, the sceptre was a gift from Pope Alexander VI to James IV in 1494. It was re-modelled and lengthened in 1536 and has small figures of the Virgin and Child, St James and St Andrew as well as a polished globe of rock crystal.\nThe Sword of State was also a papal gift from Pope Julius II to James IV in 1507 and the blade features figures of St Peter and St Paul and Pope Julius's inscription. The silver-gilt handle is decorated with oak leaves and acorns to symbolise the risen Christ and the scabbard is made of wood covered in dark red velvet and mounted with silver gilt.\nScotland's crown jewels have not had a smooth or easy journey to their present-day display cabinet at Edinburgh Castle. In mid-17th century, the hoard had to be hidden from Oliver Cromwell - who had already melted down the English Crown Jewels - and they were taken to Dunnottar Castle in Aberdeenshire before being buried in a nearby church.\u00a0\nAdvertisement\n\n\n \nFor the service, the Princess of Wales wore a Catherine Walker coat, hat by Philip Treacy and a necklace from the late Queen's collection, while her husband was dressed in his RAF No1 uniform.\u00a0\nIn a touching moment, the pair were seen joking with each other as the service got underway.\nDelivering the sermon, the Right-Reverend Foster-Fulton told the congregation that society will be on the 'right track' if we understand that 'the Heavens and Earth' are not 'human commodities or possessions'.\n'Blessed are we, on the right track are we when we understand that our children do not inherit this Earth from us - we have borrowed it from them,' she said.\n'And it is our duty to return it still singing and surging and bathing, not baking to a crisp.'\nCharles spoke extensively before becoming King about the importance of the environment, tackling climate change and protecting wildlife.\u00a0\nHe runs his Aston Martin sportscar on sustainable fuel and even recycles his bathwater at Clarence House.\nToday, spectators watched a people's procession make its way from Edinburgh Castle to the cathedral - a group around 100 strong, reflecting all aspects of Scottish society from the arts and politics, to education, civil society and business, including charities which the King supports as patron.\nAt its head was Shetland pony Corporal Cruachan IV, regimental mascot of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.\nProtesters and royal fans lined the streets, with republican groups chanting 'Not my King' countered by others shouting 'God save the King'.\nParticipants from the people's procession sat in the cathedral's pews as the Moderator said ideals like 'mercy and peace' should not be 'domesticated or downgraded' but be the 'fabric of our being'.\nShe also said that society is on the 'right track' if people are 'brave enough' to 'choose collaboration and trust over fear-filled circling of our wagons'.\n'Sisters and brothers, look around you. We are one global neighbourhood - intricately inter-related and completely co-dependent, woven together, like a tartan,' she said.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Red Arrows fly over the Royal Mile as part of a National Service of Dedication and Thanksgiving to mark the Coronation of Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla, in Edinburgh,\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Royal Airforce Red Arrows fly past after a National Service of Thanksgiving and Dedication in Edinburgh on Wednesday\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharles is presented with the Crown during today's service, which came eight weeks after Charles and Camilla were crowned in an ancient ceremony at Westminster Abbey where the King made a pledge to 'serve'\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Crown of Scotland had\u00a0 placed on the coffin of Charles' mother the late Queen during a moving service at St Giles' Cathedral after her death last year\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Princess and Prince of Wales stand alongside King Charles and Queen Camilla for their Scottish Coronation in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKing Charles laughed as William and Catherine smiled as they shared a light moment before this afternoon's service\u00a0\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWilliam and Catherine - who are known in Scotland as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, walk down the aisle of St Giles' Cathedral\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Kings Life Guard of the Household Cavalry proceed down the Royal Mile\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA Household Cavalry horse rears up at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmore videos\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n2\n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nPeople in York deny city is a 'hotbed of casual and systemic racism'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nUkranian soldiers are seen thriving in a trench in new video\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nPassengers attempt to break up fight that erupted on Ryanair flight\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nAunt claims minor niece 'sold for sex' to marine on San Diego base\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nCops on scene at Crowne Plaza Hotel after two stabbed in Surrey\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nWoman films backyard turned into raging torrent in fatal NY flooding\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nFeral cat traps to be rolled out to preserve 'native species'\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nRoads turn to rivers as New York smashed by flash flooding\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nCars and houses flooded as NY state smashed by heavy rainfall\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nInside the poison garden at Alnwick Castle that has venomous plants\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nMoment woman struck by lightning during massive storm in Russia\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWatch video \n \nVisit Valencia touts city's warm 'vibes' and incredible traditions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe service will feature centuries-old aspects of Scottish royal tradition along with new additions such as pieces of music written specially for the occasion, a psalm sung in Gaelic and the use of passages from the New Testament in Scots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you make a purchase using links on this page, MailOnline will earn an affiliate commission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook regal in blue like Kate wearing Catherine Walker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Walker bespoke coat\n\n\nSee a similar style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales made a dazzling entrance at the King's Scottish Coronation in Edinburgh.\n\n\nWe were delighted to see Kate rewearing her Catherine Walker cobalt blue coat for the third time. \n\n\nIt's evident why this design has become a beloved choice in her wardrobe.
