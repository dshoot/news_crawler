How members of The Firm began their careers with surprisingly normal jobs - from serving chips from a van to scrubbing toilets\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      It would be hard to imagine any member of the royal family scrubbing toilets, selling fish and chips from a van, or serving drinks to someone. But for a few who had humble beginnings and married into The Firm, these very normal and not very glamorous jobs were their reality. Here  MailOnline reveals the jobs which members of the royal family held before they married into The Firm - from working in a yoghurt shop in California to starting a PR business.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n shares\n    \n\n\nHow members of The Firm began careers with surprising normal jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Princess Leonor of Spain, 17, is set to begin three years of military training next month after leaving 'Hippie Hogwarts' school in Wales\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n240\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n video\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n shares\n    \n\n\nPrincess Leonor of Spain set to begin three years of military training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Is he too cool for kilts?

The tension came as Scottish Green Party co-leader Patrick Harvie, a minister in First Minister Humza Yousaf's government, branded Charles' service of thanksgiving at St Giles' Cathedral a 'Game of Thrones-style cosplay exercise.' Royal fans had earlier vented their fury after the anti-monarchy protest was\u00a0allowed to take place yards from the procession route in Edinburgh. They lined up in a specially cordoned off area from which to noisily protest, alongside well-wishers who had arrived early to bag a good spot from which to congratulate the King and Queen.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n998\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n videos\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n shares\n    \n\n\nScuffles break out between royal fans and republicans in Edinburgh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Kate's touching tribute as she wears Diana's bracelet and earrings as well as late Queen's choker\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      The Princess of Wales paid a sweet tribute to her husband's late mother and grandmother today as she wore their jewellery to King Charles' Scottish Coronation.

The new sword, named after the late Queen Elizabeth, was made specifically for the ceremony to replace the original 16th century Scottish Sword of State, which was considered too fragile to feature. It was presented to the King by Dame Katherine, 47, who won a gold medal in rowing at the 2012 London Olympics.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n shares\n    \n\n\nDame Katherine Grainger to carries King Charles's new sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          'Ladies, the equerries...': Fans left swooning as handsome royal aides are spotted\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Fans have taken to social media to share their excitement at spotting the three popular royal attendants - Major Jonathan Thompson,\u00a0Captain Ollie Plunket, and\u00a0Lieutenant Commander Rob Dixon.

Ahead of the event, the royal couple arrived early to help set up in the marquee outside of the Westminster hospital.

The Prince of Wales inherited the Duchy landed estate after his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II died and his father King Charles III acceded to the throne. William is now entitled to its surplus profits every year. The Duchy generated record profits of \u00a324.048 million in 2022-23 - up \u00a31.02 million from \u00a323.024 million the year before, a jump of about 4.5 per cent, the estate's own accounts showed. Usually William would get the \u00a324million as his private income, but his finances were complicated by him becoming heir to the throne halfway through the financial year. The King, as the former Prince of Wales, was entitled to \u00a311.275million of the surplus before his accession. And William, who spent about six months of the last financial year as the Duke of Cornwall and Prince of Wales, was entitled to \u00a312.773million. But Kensington Palace explained that as a 'one-off associated with the change in Dukes of Cornwall', the Duchy team asked to retain a proportion of the surplus for 'working capital purposes' - the day-to-day running of the estate - this year.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4k\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n video\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n shares\n    \n\n\nPrince William received a private income of nearly \u00a36million this year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Inside Kate's Marlborough College days: How future Queen flourished from a shy 'bullied' teen to the hockey captain who all the boys 'fancied rotten' at \u00a342,930 a year school\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n841\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n shares\n    \n\n\nInside Kate's college days - marmite sarnies to being 'fancied rotten'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            The stories behind Princess Diana's most iconic looks - from the Virgin Atlantic sweatshirt to her daring Hachi one-shoulder gown\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n336\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n videos\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n shares\n    \n\n\nThe stories behind Princess Diana's most iconic looks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Meghan Markle's CV before she hit the jackpot reveals the actress-turned-royal's 'special skills', height and weight\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n160\n shares\n    \n\n\nMeghan Markle's CV before she hit the jackpot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Why must we ALWAYS compare Kate to Diana?

Kate Middleton walked a runway in a sheer black dress. They were both gauche, shy, big-eyed. Both shopped on the King's Road for ballet flats so, the saying goes, they could be twins! Nooooo!

How the Duchess of Sussex reverts to her favourite pared-down look at crucial moments in her life\n10/07/23 07:35\nWith access to the very best labels that money can buy, Meghan Markle has made a special point of dressing to impress. Yet the cornerstone of her personal style is an item that suggests simplicity itself - the plain white shirt. Casual and pared-back, the combination still exudes elegance and sophistication and the style has fast become something of a trademark. But Meghan's choice of when to revert to this most basic of looks is intriguing.\n\nIt was an oversized white button-up shirt that she wore with jeans for Meghan's very first public appearance with Prince Harry at the Invictus Games in 2017, for example.\nAnd a white shirt appeared again, just a few days ago, when it emerged that the Duke and Duchess have finally said goodbye to Frogmore Cottage, their London home on the Windsor estate. This, it seems, is her go-to look for pivotal moments in her life - and new beginnings in particular.\n...read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n share\n    \n\n\nWhat does it mean when Meghan wears white shirts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean when Meghan wears white shirts?\nUS refuses to release details of Prince Harry's visa application after drug use revelations citing his 'right to privacy' despite his life in the limelight and a six-part Netflix documentary with wife Meghan Markle\u00a0\n10/07/23 03:05\nThe US government has refused to reveal details of Prince Harry's American visa due to his 'right to privacy,' documents have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n shares\n    \n\n\nOfficials REFUSES to reveal details about Prince Harry's visa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials REFUSES to reveal details about Prince Harry's visa\nBack for more!
