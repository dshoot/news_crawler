It was sent to Britain to be cleaned and conserved in 2018 before being returned to Spain.\nThe tapestry was commissioned around the\u00a0time of the Act of Supremacy of 1534, the law which declared Henry the supreme head of the Church of England.\u00a0\nIts main scene - St Paul burning heathen books on a bonfire - was requested by Henry himself.\nIt is likely he did this to demonstrate how his own proclamations against allegedly heretical books, including William Tyndale's English translation of the Bible, had clear religious backing.\u00a0\nHenry's Dissolution of the Monasteries began shortly after the tapestry was produced.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe \u00a31million being raised on donation website JustGiving would be part of a \u00a33.55million bid to the National Heritage Memorial Fund, a government-funded body that provides money to safeguard British heritage objects.\nThe new owner would be the\u00a0Zurbaran Trust, a charity which cares for the collection of art and other treasures at Auckland Castle.\u00a0\u00a0\nResearch by leading tapestry experts\u00a0Simon Franses and Thomas P Campbell confirmed the incredible quality of Henry's tapestry.\nMr Franses said in 2018 that it eclipses Hampton Court's Abraham tapestries, which are 'tame Biblical tapestries' against this 'dynamic, energetic piece'.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlmost 20 ft wide, the Burning of the Pagan Books is the only survivor from a set of nine tapestries illustrating the life of Saint Paul\u00a0\n'There's nothing to touch it in the Victoria & Albert, the Royal Collection or the National Trust,' he said.\nSpeaking of the tapestry's importance for the King, he added:\u00a0'The tapestry provided Henry VIII with powerful and unequivocal Biblical authority from one of Christ's Apostles for destruction of anything seen as heathen or ungodly.\n'This is the period of the sacking of the monasteries with widespread destruction. Around 1530, there were also specifically a series of proclamations on the destruction of \"heretical books\".\n'Here he's basically saying \"I've got religious authority to do this\". He is a political figure and needs to justify and provide authority for the less palatable things that he's doing.'\nThe St Paul tapestries were listed at Hampton Court after King Henry's death in 1547. In the 1670s, King Charles II used them in his redecoration of Windsor Castle.\u00a0\u00a0\nMr Ruffer says on the JustGiving page: 'There are two reasons why objects form the fabric of a nation.\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProduced by Flemish artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst, it shows Saint Paul (left) burning 'heathen' books at Ephesus, as recounted in the Bible's Acts of the Apostles\n'One is they are exceptional pieces of art;
