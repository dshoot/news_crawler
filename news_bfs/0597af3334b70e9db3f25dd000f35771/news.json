Baker's speech incited fury on social media and users called for Trans Pride to take a stance against the violence. Labour MP Clive Lewis shared people's anger over the comment and wrote: 'Advocating violence against others is wrong & this is no exception. But as you'll be aware violent language and actions are not unique to one side on this issue.

The former world number three had been booed at the French Open for refusing to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian opponents but here it was Azarenka, who put her hand up to acknowledge Svitolina before leaving the court, that received loud jeers.\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n video\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo champagne service for Wimbledon as tournament umpire steps in to urge spectators from opening the fizz when players are trying to take their shots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n       This is the hilarious moment a Wimbledon umpire stepped in to urge spectators not to pop champagne while the players were trying to take their shots.\u00a0Anastasia Potapova (right), 22, was gearing up to serve against 16-year-old tennis star Mirra Andreeva at the start of the match on Sunday.\u00a0But tennis fans were left highly amused at an interjection from Australian official John Blom (top inset), in what has been dubbed the 'most Wimbledon thing ever'.\u00a0\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n video\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n share\n    \n\n\nMoment Wimbledon umpire urges spectators not to open champagne\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Jeremy Vine threatens legal action against trolls as BBC stars line up to deny they are presenter suspended following accusation about paying teen for sexual photos - while Tim Davie blasts 'unsubstantiated' speculation on social media\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Mr Vine, 58, has told social media users who allegedly libelled him\u00a0that he has screenshotted their 'defamatory' tweets and his lawyer 'will be in touch in the coming days'.

Sir Roger Tichborne is my name / I'm seeking now for wealth and fame /They say that I was lost at sea / But I tell them, 'Oh dear, no, not me.' A man claiming to be Sir Roger (left), the heir to a title and vast fortune, who had long been presumed dead, had arrived in England from Australia - and the rest of the aristocratic Tichborne family was fighting a furious legal battle to have him declared a fraudster. The man turned out to be Arthur Orton, also called Fatty Orton (right). The British public lapped it up. Everything about the tale was outrageous and scandalous: it had romance, sex, snobbery, slavery, drama, lies and unimaginable sums of money. Now the author Zadie Smith (inset) has seized on the story, reinventing it in a novel called The Fraud, set to be published this autumn.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n shares\n    \n\n\n28-stone thief who convinced rich aristocrat he was her long-lost son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Record number of repeat knife crime offenders are spared jail - with one racking up an unprecedented 45 convictions, shock figures reveal\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        Shock figures have raised questions about the scale of reoffending by knife criminals, with suspended sentences for habitual offenders almost doubling in the past decade.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n comments\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n shares\n    \n\n\nRecord number of repeat knife crime offenders are spared jail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Will China use electric cars to spy on UK drivers?

Now, a new book (inset) details the secret lives and history of the American dynasty inside their elusive compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, from the golden age of Camelot to their tragic 'Kennedy curse.' The home is where John Kennedy took his new fiance Jacqueline Bouvier to meet his family for the first time in 1953 (top right). It's where the family collected after every Thanksgiving to play touch football on the front lawn. And where they grieved the deaths of their eldest brother, Joe Jr. - the one destined for greatness- who died in WWII; and their sister, Kick Kennedy whose plane crashed in France with her married lover on board. It's where the family mourned the assassinations of President John F.
